Looking at the backtrace output, which function called syscall?
    usertrap()
What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent? (Hint: look user/initcode.S, the first user program xv6 starts.)
    0x7
What was the previous mode that the CPU was in?
    0
Why does the kernel crash? Hint: look at figure 3-3 in the text; is address 0 mapped in the kernel address space? Is that confirmed by the value in scause above? (See description of scause in RISC-V privileged instructions)
    because it trys to read value in addrese 0x0, which is not in kernel address space(according to book-riscv-rev3.pdf, Figure 3-3)
    scause is 0b1101, shows it is a load page fault
What is the name of the binary that was running when the kernel paniced? What is its process id (pid)?
    the binary that was running is initcode
    pid is 1
