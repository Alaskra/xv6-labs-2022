## Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf? 
    registers which have prefix a holds arguments, a0 holds first argument, a1 second and so on
    a2 holds 13.
## Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.) 
    the call to f in main is optimized to result 12.
    the call to g in f is also optimized.
## At what address is the function printf located? 
    0x630
## What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main? 
    0x38
## What's the output? If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?
    He110 World
    set i to 0x726c6400
    no
## In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen? 
    the value of regster a2 will be printed, because according to calling convention, the third argument is stored in a2, though the caller not set it.
